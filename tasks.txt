Final project must include:
- access delegation caddy -+ (not sure if reverse proxy is enough which we have)
- separate networks +
- some virtual processes +
- backups (script to backup database volume or file) +
- migrations: (on startup load initial data to database ) -
- different OS for different containers (ex.: ubuntu and debian) + 
- data storage in volumes buckets or other storage facilities (add volume to database container) +
- some form of automation for deployment and updates ? (do we need ansible for this?)
- architectural diagram with explanations ---
