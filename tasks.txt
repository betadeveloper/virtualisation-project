Final project must include:
- access delegation caddy + (not sure if reverse proxy is enough which we have)
- separate networks +
- some virtual processes +
- backups (script to backup database volume or file) +
- migrations: (on startup load initial data to database, through ansible playbook task ) -
- different OS for different containers (ex.: ubuntu and debian) + 
- data storage in volumes buckets or other storage facilities (add volume to database container) +
- some form of automation for deployment and updates ? (do we need ansible for this?)
- architectural diagram with explanations ---

Mantas asks professor for clarification: 
is access delegation done ? Is it enough just to route requests to different continers based on rules - answer: yes, thats what it is
migrations - we should move the database initialization to ansible playbook tasks (create a folder database_migrations, where sql files would be stored and would be run )
deployment automation

Prat and Tomi works on architectural diagrams

Raigardas works on moving SQL setup to ansible playbook tasks 

Everyone takes a look at the repository and makes notes of places they dont understand
